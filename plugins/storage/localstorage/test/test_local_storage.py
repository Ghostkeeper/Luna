Note that this test suite is meant to also test the behaviour of concurrent
operations to the file system. This requires actual file writes. This sort of
thing is very dependent on the operating system the tests are run on, and the
atomicity of operations even more so. The concurrency tests should therefore be
assumed to only hold for the operating system that the tests are running on.
