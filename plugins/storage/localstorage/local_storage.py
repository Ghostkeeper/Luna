"""
An implementation of persistent storage that reads and writes from the hard
drive.

All of these operations are explicitly atomic. Multiple threads or processes
should never be working on the same data to prevent race conditions, but the
user opening multiple instances of the application can't be prevented. This
atomicity doesn't prevent race conditions in these cases, but at least prevents
data corruption.
