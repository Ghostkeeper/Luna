"""
An implementation of persistent storage that reads and writes from the hard
drive.

All of these operations are explicitly atomic. This atomicity depends on the
operating system in some part, but all of the supported operating systems
(Windows, Linux) ensure that this is possible. Not all cases of concurrent
reading and writing can be accounted for, however. In particular, if a foreign
application writes directly in the file this will not be accounted for. When
dealing only with other instances of the same application, these functions
should behave atomically.
