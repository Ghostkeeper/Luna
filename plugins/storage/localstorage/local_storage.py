"""
An implementation of persistent storage that reads and writes from the hard
drive.

All of these operations are explicitly atomic. Multiple threads or processes
should never be working on the same data to prevent race conditions, but the
user opening multiple instances of the application can't be prevented. This
atomicity doesn't prevent race conditions in these cases, but at least prevents
data corruption.

def read(uri):
	"""
	Reads the contents of the specified file.

	This read is done atomically, meaning that it will return the state of the
	file at a single instance in time. This is achieved fairly naively by
	tracking the time of last modification in the file system, and re-trying to
	read when the time of last modification changed while the reading was in
	progress. As a result, this method is lock-free but not wait-free. It may be
	retrying indefinitely if the file keeps getting updated during the read.
	However, this algorithm is simple to implement and introduces very little
	overhead if there is nobody writing, which is the main use case.

	This algorithm is only atomic in the theoretical case of infinite time
	resolution on the last modification time stamp of the file system. This is
	obviously incorrect, but nothing better can be achieved without requiring
	all writers to the file to keep record of their precise modification count
	or something like that. On UNIX-based file systems, the time resolution is
	typically 1ns, which is more than enough. On Windows's file system, NTFS,
	the resolution is 100ns, which is often enough, except for very small files.
	On FAT, however, the time resolution is 2s, which basically obliterates the
	atomicity of this function for all but the largest files.
	This could be fixed by introducing a sleep just before the file read that is
	equal to the resolution of the time stamp, but this is deemed too costly for
	the time cost of a file read operation. It could also be improved by reading
	the file twice, and re-trying until the last two reads are equal, but that
	is also too costly, since it requires two reads for the base case where
	nothing modifies the file.

	:param uri: The URI of the resource to read.
	:return: The contents of the resource, as a bytes string.
	:raises IOError: The data could not be read.

def write(uri, data):
	"""
	Writes data to a resource.

	Any old data in the resource will get overwritten. If no resource exists at
	the specified location, a new resource will be created.

	This writing is done atomically, meaning that it will appear as if the
	writing is made instantaneously. This is done by writing the data to a
	temporary file, then moving the new file on top of the old file. Therefore,
	the actual atomicity of this write depends on the atomicity of ``move``.
