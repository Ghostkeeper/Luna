		does not expose the functionality. And thirdly, though one could expect
		that the flush would atomically write the current buffer to the target
		file, this would be prohibitively expensive to perform since it requires
		making a new copy of the current buffer before moving the old buffer to
		the file, and the first operation takes linear time to the size of the
