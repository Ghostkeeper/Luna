"""
An API for storing data in a persistent storage.

This API defines ways to store data, to read data back from storage, and some
administrative tasks that acts as shortcuts for multiple tasks, such as moving
data.

def exists(uri):
	"""
	.. function:: exists(uri)
	Checks whether an entity exists at the specified location.

	The URI is taken relative to the application's working directory. That means
	that any relative URIs will check for files, since the working directory has
	the file schema.

	Any plug-in that reports it can read from the URI will be used to check for
	its existence. If there are multiple plug-ins that can read from the URI, an
	arbitrary one will be chosen.

		doesn't.

def move(source, destination):
	"""
	.. function:: move(source, destination)
	Moves data from one place to another.

	Both URIs are taken relative to the application's working directory. That
	means that any relative URIs will always move files, since the working
	directory has the file schema.

	Any plug-in that reports it can read from the source and write to the
	destination will be used to move the data. If there are multiple plug-ins
	that can do both, an arbitrary one will be chosen. If there are none that
	can do both, a plug-in will be chosen to read the data from the source, and
	a different plug-in will be chosen to write the data to the destination.
