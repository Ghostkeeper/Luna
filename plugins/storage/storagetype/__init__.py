Provides functionality to save and load data to a persistent storage location.

This could be used to retain data between multiple runs of the application, such
as user preferences, or it could be used to gain additional input from an
external source, such as the file system, or save the output to a place where
other applications can access it.

The API of this plug-in type is based on "files" with a unique URI. If the
storage intended is not based on URI, a plug-in may have to emulate it and
devise a custom scheme for the URI.
