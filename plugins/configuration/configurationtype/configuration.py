"""
An API for storing and retrieving configuration data of the application.

This API is used by retrieving the configuration types as attributes of this
API. These attributes contain configuration instances, which behave in the same
way. For instance, imagine a configuration type called "preferences". These
preferences contain a preference category called "user_interface", which then
contain a preference called "language". That preference would then be accessed
like this::

	luna.plugins("configuration").preferences.user_interface.language

You can change the value of a preference in a similar way::

	luna.plugins("configuration").preferences.user_interface.language = "Quenya"

Adding new items to the configuration behaves differently, since new entries may
require additional metadata. A configuration item can only be created via the
``define`` method, like so::

	luna.plugins("configuration").preferences.user_interface.define(
		key="language"
		default="Common"
		validate=lambda language_key: language_key in luna.plugins("internationalisation").languages
	)

This would define a preference called "language". It specifies the default
value, from which the data type is also inferred. And it specifies a validation
function, which checks that a value must be one of the supported languages.

Getting or setting a configuration item that doesn't exist yields an
``AttributeError``.

		MIME type, the file is not created.
