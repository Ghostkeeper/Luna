"""
An API for storing and retrieving configuration data of the application.

This API is used by way of key-value pairs. This API behaves like a dictionary.
Every configuration type adds an entry to this dictionary with as key the
identifier of the configuration plug-in and as value a similar dictionary. This
way a hierarchical structure of configuration is produced in dictionaries. For
instance, you could get a preference like this::

	luna.plugins("configuration")["preference"]["user interface"]["language"]

You can change the value of a preference in a similar way::

	luna.plugins("configuration")["preference"]["user interface"]["language"] = "Quenya"

Adding new items to the configuration behaves differently from a normal
dictionary. A configuration item can only be created via the ``define``
function, like so::

	luna.plugins("configuration")["preference"]["user interface"].define(
		key="language"
		data_type="language"
		default="Common"
		validate=lambda language_key: language_key in luna.plugins("internationalisation").languages
	)

Getting or setting an item that doesn't exist yields a ``KeyError``.

It is up to the specific configuration plug-in to decide how to store the
information persistently. It may store each unique path to a unique file on the
file system, or choose to store everything in one file. It may even choose to
store this information remotely.

An element of configuration that holds a bit more information than just the
value of the configuration item.

It needs to track a bit of metadata, too. To that end it contains the following
fields:
* ``value``: The actual value of the configuration. The "data" as it were.
* ``data_type``: The type of data contained in this entry. This needs to be the
identity of a data type plug-in.
* ``validate``: A validation predicate, which indicates whether a specific value
is allowed in this configuration entry.

	provided that adds new entries, but requires a bit more information.
	* Setting the value of an entry is subject to restrictions. This class only
	forbids changing the value of ``configuration``-type settings. It is
