class ValidatedDictionary(dict):
	"""
	A dictionary-like data structure where all values are validated.

	New keys can only be added by also providing a validator predicate. Adding
	new keys can't be done with the usual ``dictionary[key] = value``, but via a
	separate method ``add``. Adding new keys in the usual way would result in an
	exception stating that the key cannot be found.

	When setting a key to a new value, the predicate associated with the key
	will be executed to determine whether the value is allowed. If the value is
	not allowed, an exception will be raised.

	As an additional feature, items in this dictionary can be reset to their
	original value, that they were set to when they were defined. This is to
	further serve the task that this dictionary was intended for in
	configuration.

	For the rest, this class should behave like an ordinary dictionary.

	This is a named tuple consisting of the following fields:
	* default: The default value for the item, meaning the original value. This

	in this item.
