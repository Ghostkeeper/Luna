Experiments
===========
One of the goals listed in :doc:`goals` is to explore more exotic programming techniques. The experiments towards this goal are listed in this document.

+-------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Experiment  | Status    | Report                                             |
+=============+===========+====================================================+
| Everything  | Completed | Success. This really forces the programmer to      |
| is a        |           | think hard on what the API should be. It makes     |
| plug-in     |           | unit tests easier to write. It makes writing       |
|             |           | concurrent code easier. Unit tests via CMake is    |
|             |           | harder.                                            |
+-------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Plug-in     | Completed | Mostly a success. This makes concurrency easier.   |
| type        |           | It reduces the amount of tests that need to be     |
| plug-ins    |           | written. It allows for hot-pluggable plug-ins due  |
|             |           | to the registering functionality. However, it      |
|             |           | introduces a lot of boilerplate code. Perhaps some |
|             |           | of that can still be factored out. Forces the      |
|             |           | programmer to make every plug-in have a plug-in    |
|             |           | type in order to specify an API for it, even if    |
|             |           | there will really never be more than one           |
|             |           | implementation of the type.                        |
+-------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Model       | Completed | Largely a success. Difficult to implement.         |
| change      |           | Difficult to debug. Makes onChange listeners       |
| listeners   |           | extremely easy and elegant to use. Forces the      |
|             |           | programmer to use an explicit state that gets      |
|             |           | updated rather than firing an event, so this makes |
|             |           | code more clear. Elegance is nice. Dict, set and   |
|             |           | list are immutable in Python which requires them   |
|             |           | to be used in a less elegant manner. Also,         |
|             |           | module-global variables cannot be listened to      |
|             |           | directly.                                          |
+-------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Unit tests  | Completed | Failed to make generic unit tests. Making tests    |
| for         |           | for individual cases was successful though, and    |
| concurrency |           | this technique can be applied to other atomicity   |
|             |           | tests as well in a similar way, but the            |
|             |           | implementation needs to be so vastly different     |
|             |           | that no generic library could be made.             |
