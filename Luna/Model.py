"""
Provides a system for the model part of the model-view-presenter paradigm.

To use the model system properly, the following code changes are required:
- Give all classes that are part of the model the ``@model`` decorator.
- To let the view update whenever the model is changed, call the ``listenTo``
  function of the model. Supply the member of the model that contains the data,
  and a reference to the function in the view that will update the view.
- The listening functions of the view must have no parameters other than
  ``self``. Otherwise they can't be called by the signalling system.
