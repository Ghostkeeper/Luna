"""
Provides a system for the model part of the model-view-presenter paradigm.

To use the model system properly, the following code changes are required:

- To let the view update whenever the model is changed, call the ``listen``
  function of the model. Supply a callable object that must be called whenever a
  change is made to the model.
- The listener must accept two parameters: the attribute that was changed and
  the new value for the attribute.

import functools #To copy documentation to function wrappers and for partial function calls.
import inspect #To check if listeners are bound methods, so we need to make a different type of reference then.
import weakref #To automatically remove listeners if their class instances are removed.

def listen(listener, instance, attribute=None):
	"""
	Listen for changes of the specified attribute or the specified instance.

	If no attribute is provided, the listener will get called when any of the
	attributes of the specified field change. If an attribute is provided, the
	listener will only get called when the specified attribute is changed. The
	listener will get called with as first argument the attribute that changed
	(as a string) and as second argument the new value of the attribute.

	If the attribute was set, but set to the same value as it was before, the
	listeners are not called. It does not count as a change.

	Listening is "shallow". This means that internal changes inside the value of
	an attribute will not constitute a change. Only if the attribute itself has
	changed will it trigger the listeners.

	Listening to instances or attributes of instances requires changing the
	object inherently to add extra methods, overriding `__setattribute__`, and
	to add extra fields to hold the listeners. This is not possible if the class
	of the instance is defined natively (for instance with a `list` or `dict`)
	or if the class has a `__slots__` field. For those cases, it is advisable to
	use a transparent wrapper.
	:param listener: A callable object that takes two arguments for its call.
	The first argument should be interpreted as the name of the attribute that
	changed. The second argument should be interpreted as the new value for the
	attribute.
	:param instance: The instance to listen to for changes.
	:param attribute: If set, the name of the attribute of the instance to
	listen to for changes. If this is `None`, all attribute changes of the
