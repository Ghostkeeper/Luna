"""
Provides a system for the model part of the model-view-presenter paradigm.

To use the model system properly, the following code changes are required:

- Give all classes that are part of the model the ``@model`` decorator.
- To let the view update whenever the model is changed, call the ``listen``
  function of the model. Supply a callable object that must be called whenever a
  change is made to the model.
- The listener must be callable without any parameters.
