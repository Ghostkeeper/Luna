"""
Provides a system for the model part of the model-view-presenter paradigm.

To use the model system properly, the following code changes are required:
- Give all classes that are part of the model the ``@model`` decorator.
- To let the view update whenever the model is changed, call the ``listen``
  function of the model. Supply a callable object that must be called whenever a
  change is made to the model.
- The listener must be callable without any parameters.
"""

import functools #To retain the documentation and name of the wrapped functions by these decorators.
import inspect #To check if listeners are bound methods, so we need to make a different type of reference then.
import weakref #To automatically remove listeners if their class instances are removed.
